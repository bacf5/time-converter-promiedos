## Description

Changes the time from GMT-3 to CEST in the Promiedos.com.ar website for Argentinians living abroad.

## Motivation

Honestly, I was tired of just trying to quickly check the day's football schedule while I was busy or thinking about something else. I'd see the kick-off time, then realize I had to do the math to figure out what time the game was actually playing where I live. This should be a native feature of the site! I even reached out to them to see if they could implement it since it can't be that hard. But despite checking out other websites for daily results and fixtures, I always end up coming back to Promiedos.com.ar.
